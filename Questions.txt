1. What is the product’s name (your Mo-Something app)?
    MoKaraoke

2. What is the function + connection?
    The app's function is to create a karaoke video from an inputted audio file and background image.
    The connection is to allow users to upload their Generated Karaoke videos to youtube.

3. Why did you choose to make the product?
    I chose to make this product because there are many aleternative / underground songs out there.
    These songs do not have karaoke videos for them, and I'd like to make it easier to create videos for these songs.

4. Why would MoFlo clients (small and medium sized businesses) be interested in and/or use this product?
    MoFlo clients could use this app to create karaoke videos. I can see two main use cases for this app:
    1. MoFlo clients could use this app to improve company morale internally by creating karaoke videos for their company's songs.
    2. MoFlo clients (specifically music companies) could use this app to create karaoke videos for their songs ( which could be used for marketing purposes)
5. What would you improve or change about your new product if you had more time or could work on it in the future?

    1. I'd like to add more authentication and user management features to the app.
    2. I'd like to actually implement the karaoke video creation feature.
    3. I'd like to add the ability to update video titles and descriptions once they've been uploaded.
